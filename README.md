# Simple React Native Front-End Project

This is my final project in Mobile Development subject. I worked on this project with my group.
DondonApp is a front-end user-friendly React Native application designed to revolutionize the restaurant dining experience.
It empowers restaurants and customers by providing a smooth and efficient online food ordering and in-app payment processing platform.
